	  				To understand who we are, you'll need to understand why we started. Push Refresh was kind of a satirical name for our company at first, but after thinking a little more about it, it made perfect sense! If you're familiar with our industry, you're probably familiar with the term "push refresh". Having been in this industry for close to a decade, we've used this phrase WAY too much! Now lets say that you have no idea what this phrase means, we'll gladly explain. Head up to the top of our webpage and push the refresh button. See? Updated page! (Still confused?) What we do is help people create a completely new brand for their venture. If you already have an established brand but are looking for a change (or just plain bored), we can <span class="a-fix" id="refresh-def">"refresh"</span> your look to something that's (as the kids say) <span class="a-fix" id="hip-def">"hip"</span>.
					<br><br>
					Still confused? It's a pretty simple process, but one thing that we consider an advantage is we have a small team and personally choose the clients we work with. We want to create a great site/brand that we will be proud of as well as a finished product our client will be <span class="a-fix" id="thrilled-def">thrilled</span> about. 
					<br><br>
	  				Have more questions? That's cool with us! Head on over to our <a href="/contact.php" class="a-fix">contact</a> page and let's chat about how we can work together. Doubting our <span class="a-fix" id="jedi-def">Jedi</span> skills? No worries, we get it! If you'd like to see some of our current work head over to our <a href="/work.php" class="a-fix">work</a> page and see some of our recent projects.
